# Google Calendar Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide will help you set up Google Calendar integration for your cleaning service booking system. When a booking is confirmed and paid for, it will automatically create an appointment in the business owner's Google Calendar.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

### **1. Google Cloud Console Setup**

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Note your Project ID

2. **Enable Google Calendar API**

   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"

3. **Create Service Account (Recommended for Single Business Owner)**

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Give it a name like "cleaning-service-calendar"
   - Click "Create and Continue"
   - Skip role assignment, click "Done"
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" > "Create New Key" > "JSON"
   - Download the JSON file and save it securely

4. **Share Calendar with Service Account**
   - Open your Google Calendar
   - Find your calendar in the left sidebar
   - Click the three dots next to it > "Settings and sharing"
   - Scroll down to "Share with specific people"
   - Click "Add people"
   - Add the service account email (found in the JSON file: `client_email`)
   - Give it "Make changes to events" permission
   - Click "Send"

### **2. Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Google Calendar Integration (Service Account)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary  # or specific calendar ID
```

**Important**: Copy the `client_email` and `private_key` from your downloaded JSON file.

### **3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install googleapis google-auth-library
```

### **4. Database Migration**

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add Google Calendar event ID field to bookings table
ALTER TABLE bookings
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS google_calendar_event_id VARCHAR(255);

-- Add index for Google Calendar event ID lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bookings_google_calendar_event_id
ON bookings(google_calendar_event_id);
```

### **5. That's It!**

No manual connection needed! The system will automatically create calendar events for all confirmed bookings.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### **Payment-First Architecture with Calendar Integration**

```
Customer Form â†’ Stripe Checkout â†’ Payment Success â†’ Webhook â†’ Database + Google Calendar
     â†“              â†“                â†“              â†“         â†“              â†“
   No DB         Metadata        Webhook         Create     Booking      Calendar
   Entry         Storage         Trigger         Booking    Created      Event
```

### **Key Components**

1. **`lib/google-calendar.ts`** - Google Calendar service using Service Account
2. **`src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`** - Creates calendar events after payment
3. **No OAuth routes needed** - Service Account handles authentication automatically

### **Event Details**

Each calendar event includes:

- **Title**: "Cleaning Service - [Customer Name]"
- **Location**: Service address
- **Description**: Complete service details, customer info, and booking details
- **Duration**: Based on service type (2-8 hours)
- **Attendees**: Customer email (they'll receive calendar invites)
- **Reminders**: 24-hour email and 1-hour popup reminders

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### **Test the Integration**

1. **Create a Test Booking**

   - Go to `/booking`
   - Fill out the form
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

2. **Check Calendar**

   - Go to your Google Calendar
   - Verify the appointment was created
   - Check that customer received email invitation

3. **Test Recurring Services**
   - Create a weekly/bi-weekly booking
   - Verify calendar events are created for each recurring payment

### **Test Cards**

- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### **Service Account Security**

- Never commit service account JSON to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate service account keys
- Monitor service account usage in Google Cloud Console

### **Calendar Permissions**

- The service account has "Make changes to events" permission only
- Customers receive calendar invites but can't modify your calendar
- All events are created in your primary calendar (or specified calendar)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Failed to create Google Calendar event"**

   - Check service account credentials are correct
   - Verify Google Calendar API is enabled
   - Ensure calendar is shared with service account email
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

2. **"Service account not found"**

   - Verify the service account email in environment variables
   - Check that the service account exists in Google Cloud Console

3. **"Calendar event not created after payment"**

   - Check webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
   - Verify service account has calendar access
   - Check server logs for calendar creation errors

4. **"Customer not receiving calendar invites"**
   - Verify customer email is correct
   - Check spam folder
   - Ensure `sendUpdates: 'all'` is set in calendar event creation

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check Server Logs**

   ```bash
   # Look for these log messages:
   # "Google Calendar event created: [event_id]"
   # "Failed to create Google Calendar event: [error]"
   ```

2. **Verify Service Account Setup**

   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify calendar sharing permissions
   - Test service account access manually

3. **Check Calendar Permissions**
   - Verify the service account has calendar access
   - Check if calendar ID is correct

## ðŸ“Š Production Deployment

### **Before Going Live**

1. **Update Service Account**

   - Use production service account credentials
   - Ensure calendar is shared with production service account
   - Configure proper IAM roles if needed

2. **Environment Variables**

   ```env
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-production-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary
   ```

3. **Test Production Flow**
   - Test with real payment methods
   - Verify calendar events are created
   - Check customer email delivery

### **Monitoring**

1. **Monitor Webhook Failures**

   - Check Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks
   - Monitor server logs for calendar creation errors

2. **Calendar Usage**
   - Monitor Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Dashboard
   - Check calendar API quota usage

## ðŸ”„ Advanced Features

### **Custom Calendar ID**

To use a specific calendar instead of primary:

```env
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id_here
```

### **Custom Event Duration**

Modify duration in `lib/google-calendar.ts`:

```typescript
private calculateEndTime(date: string, time: string, serviceType: string): string {
  // Customize duration based on your business needs
  const durationHours = {
    'regular-cleaning': 2,
    'deep-cleaning': 4,
    'move-in-move-out': 6,
    'post-construction': 8,
  }[serviceType] || 2;
  // ...
}
```

### **Custom Reminders**

Modify reminders in calendar event creation:

```typescript
reminders: {
  useDefault: false,
  overrides: [
    { method: 'email', minutes: 24 * 60 }, // 24 hours
    { method: 'popup', minutes: 60 }, // 1 hour
    { method: 'email', minutes: 7 * 24 * 60 }, // 1 week
  ],
},
```
