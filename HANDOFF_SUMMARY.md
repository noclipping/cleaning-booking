### **Key Flow**
```
Customer Form → Stripe Checkout → Payment Success → Webhook → Database
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓         ↓
   No DB         Metadata        Webhook         Create     Booking
   Entry         Storage         Trigger         Booking    Created
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Cards**
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- 3D Secure: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

### **Testing Flow**
1. Go to `/booking` and fill form
2. Use test card for payment

## 📚 Documentation

### **Available Guides**
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `SETUP.md` - Detailed Stripe setup instructions
- `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md` - New developer guide
- `test-stripe.md` - Testing instructions
- `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## 🔍 Known Issues & Considerations

### **Current Limitations**
- No user authentication (admin dashboard is public)
- No email notifications (can be added)
- No customer portal (can be added)
- Limited admin features (can be expanded)

### **Potential Improvements**
- Add user authentication for admin dashboard
- Implement email notifications for bookings
- Add customer portal for booking management
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
- SMS notifications
- Calendar integration

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Security**
- Webhook signature verification is critical - never disable
- Environment variables must be kept secure
- Database backups recommended before major changes

### **Payment Flow**
- **Never modify** the payment-first approach without understanding implications
- Always test webhook delivery before going live
- Monitor webhook failures in production

### **Recurring Services**
- Test thoroughly as they create multiple bookings over time
- Monitor subscription status in Stripe Dashboard
- Handle subscription cancellations properly

## 🎯 Next Steps for New Developer

1. **Review Architecture**: Understand the payment-first approach
2. **Set Up Environment**: Configure all environment variables
3. **Test Complete Flow**: From booking to payment to admin dashboard
4. **Familiarize with Code**: Review critical files mentioned above
5. **Plan Improvements**: Consider adding authentication, notifications, etc.
